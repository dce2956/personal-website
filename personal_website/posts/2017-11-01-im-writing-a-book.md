I've known for a couple months now that this is happening, and I'm even putting
the finishing touches on chapter 1 with my editor now, but I think it's time to
talk about it.

I love Ruby. I always will. While it wasn't my first programming language (that
would be BASIC), or even my first "modern" language (that would be Python), it's
the first language where I felt like I was part of a community, and where I
really found joy in programming. It's a wonderful language, and a wonderful
community.

The best thing about Ruby (IMHO) is that it's more than just an object oriented
language. It has strong functional bits baked right into the very core of it,
right down to the trusty block, which is one of Ruby's killer features. If
you've written Ruby in the last 10 years, chances are you've been doing a little
bit of functional programming to compliment your OO programming as well. This
stuff is really cool and very powerful, and it deserves to have a light shined
on it.

And so that's what I'll be exploring in _The Joy of Ruby_, which will be
published by Manning Books sometime in 2018. Just to get one thing out of the
way, no, this isn't a book about "functional programming in Ruby." While I do
really enjoy functional programming, I don't think that going whole hog on FP in
Ruby is a great way to go. I _do_, however, think that we can embrace the
functional stuff that is part of Ruby's DNA **more**, and that by doing so we
can write better applications.

I also have to admit that I'm kind of scared to be writing this book. I'm fairly
confident that a good number of people in the community, some whom I deeply
respect, will disagree with the thesis of this book. That's ok. Luckily I know
those people will be kind in their disagreement. It took me two months to agree
to write this book, and most of that delay was because of this big mental hurdle
for me. I thought that obviously if folks I respect might disagree with what
I have to say, then clearly what I have to say is invalid.

I realized, though, that that's not true. There are many other people who agree
with what I'm going to be covering in this book, and I respect many of them as
well. I'm writing this book for those people. If 60 out of 100 programmers think
I'm wrong, it's ok as long as the other 40 get some value out of the book. It's
ok to have a different opinion as long as people don't get mean about those
differences. And in the absence of empirical facts, opinions and reasoned logic
are really all we have. I trust that in our wonderful Ruby community, this won't
be a problem. 

So, if you want to be notified when the book is ready for purchase (and most
likely with some sort of discount code), you can pop your email address in the
form [here](/fir), and I'll write when there's news to share.
