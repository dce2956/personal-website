                At Forza FC I led and managed a team of 4 backend developers as well as two teams
                of mobile developers. My management responsibilities include coordinating the
                day-to-day work of the teams, working together with the CTO on architectural
                decisions, working with the product team on task management and prioritization,
                improving team working processes and dynamics, and the personal and professional
                development of the developers on the backend team and team leads of the mobile
                teams. I also spent some of my time as an individual contributor, helping to
                develop features and fix bugs on the platform.

                I was hired as an early member of Sketch's backend engineering team. I worked
                across the organization to help teach, train and mentor my teammates, and I
                contributed to building and refining their Sketch Cloud product, including soft
                real-time collaboration features, with a focus on code quality and team
                collaboration.

                I was brought in to Klarna to help train and lead a new team that was

                maintain and develop. These applications are at the core of Klarnaâ€™s
                business and have extreme uptime, latency and throughput requirements.

                Orchard Systems hired me to help them develop the MVP of their product,
                which consisted of an embedded Elixir application and a GraphQL API.
                The API had several different clients with soft real-time requirements
                and used Phoenix Channels heavily, and the embedded application was an
                OTP application that ran on a custom Linux build. The API was designed
                and tested to handle up to 2,000 requests per second.

                Elixir and Phoenix. Many of these were internal tools that would help
                their data science team ingest, analyze and clean data from unreliable
                sources.
