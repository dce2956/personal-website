                I was hired as an early member of Sketch's backend engineering team. I work across
                the organization to help teach, train and mentor my teammates, and I contribute to
                building and refining their Sketch Cloud product, including soft real-time
                collaboration features, with a focus on code quality and team collaboration.

                business and have extreme uptime, latency and throughput requirements.

                Orchard Systems hired me to help them develop the MVP of their product,
                which consisted of an embedded Elixir application and a GraphQL API.
                The API had several di erent clients with soft real-time requirements
                and used Phoenix Channels heavily, and the embedded application was an
                OTP application that ran on a custom Linux build. The API was designed
                and tested to handle up to 2,000 requests per second.

                This client brought me on to help them migrate a significant portion of their
                application that were CPU bound to Elixir, and to help train their growing team.
                By the end of the contract their team had grown from 6 to 13 developers and p99
                latencies for the parts of the application I helped to migrate had fallen by 80%
                (122ms to 24ms).

                their data science team ingest, analyze and clean data from unreliable
                sources.
