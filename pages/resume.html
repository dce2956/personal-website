                As a Staff Engineer in Remote's Platform and Ecosystem vertical, I lead the
                development of large, cross-team product and engineering initiatives. I am also an
                active mentor for many of my fellow Platform and Ecosystem engineers, and play an
                important role in defining, maintaining, and improving engineering culture and
                best-practices both within our vertical and across the broader engineering
                organization at Remote.

                As the team lead for the Integrations Platform team at Remote, I managed a
                full-stack team of 7 developers. Our team's focus was building integrations
                between Remote's platform and other 3rd parties, as well as designing and
                developing Remote's public API.

                At Forza FC I managed a team of 4 backend developers as well as two teams of
                mobile developers. My management responsibilities include coordinating the
                day-to-day work of the teams, working together with the CTO on architectural
                decisions, working with the product team on task management and prioritization,
                improving team working processes and dynamics, and the personal and professional
                development of the developers on the backend team and team leads of the mobile
                teams. I also spent some of my time as an individual contributor, helping to
                develop features and fix bugs on the platform.

                applications that they needed to maintain and develop. These applications were at
                the core of Klarnaâ€™s business and had extreme uptime, latency and throughput
                requirements.

                Orchard Systems hired me to help them develop the MVP of their product,
                which consisted of an embedded Elixir application and a GraphQL API.
                The API had several different clients with soft real-time requirements
                and used Phoenix Channels heavily, and the embedded application was an
                OTP application that ran on a custom Linux build. The API was designed
                and tested to handle up to 2,000 requests per second.
