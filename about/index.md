Howdy! My name is Devon, and I write code. Most of the time when I'm writing code people pay me to do it, but sometimes I write code just for fun! I'm one of the maintainers of [Benchee](https://github.com/PragTob/benchee) and of the [Elixir track](https://github.com/exercism/elixir) on [exercism.io](https://www.exercism.io). I also like contributing to [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir), [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo), [Scenic](https://github.com/thoughtbot/scenic), and [RSpec Core](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core). If you hadn't guessed, open source is pretty important to me. You can see all my open source stuff on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/devonestes).

I also do other things for fun, like spending time with my family, playing chess, and studying German. Well, to be honest, studying German isn't _really_ for fun, but mostly because I live in Germany, and speaking German is a really useful skill to have when you live in Germany. I've lived in Berlin since 2015, and before that I lived in California and New York (although never at the same time).

Occasionally I also get up in front of people to talk about things that are interesting to me. Here's a partial list of some of the talks and workshops I've given:

* Inside memory management on the BEAM - [Code BEAM Lite Munich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAeLuZN7J6Y) 2018
* Digging through the garbage - [Code BEAM Lite Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqLujfzvUgM) 2018 and Elixir Berlin 2019
* It's a Small World - [LambdaDays](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/devon-estes) 2018 and Elixir Berlin 2018
* Functions in Ruby - [Ruby Dev Summit](https://rubydevsummit.com/) 2017 and Ruby User Group Berlin (RUG::B) 2017
* Refactoring Elixir: Lessons Learned From A Year on Exercism.io - [ElixirConf.eu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJMrtJEK1A) 2017 and Elixir Berlin 2017
* Make Your Life Easier with Shell Scripting and UNIX Tools - RailsConf 2017
* The Fun in Functional - [RubyDay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7opGxpGw3k) 2016
* The Beginner's Guide to Open Source - Newbie Remote Conf 2016
